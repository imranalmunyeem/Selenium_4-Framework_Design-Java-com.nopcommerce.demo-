#### Error 1: The compiler compliance specified is 1.8 but a JRE 15 is used
     Solution: Either ensure the proper JRE is there or go to the Windows->Preferences->Java->Compiler and make sure your compliance setting matches.


#### Error 2: Build path specifies execution environment Java SE 1.7
     Solution:  In Eclipse -> your project-> properties -> java build path : Libraries ->Remove the "JRE System Library[J2SE 1.4]" -> click "Add Library" button -> JRE System Library -> select the new "Executin Environment" or Workspace default JRE
